# We check in a new patient in a hospital named John Smith. His age is 20 and is a new patient.
# Write a program to define his name, age and check if he is new or not.

patient_name = 'John Smith' # Strings are defined with quotes. Variables are used to store value in memory.
patient_age = 20 # Integer value stored in variable
is_new_patient = True #Boolean Value stored in variable.

print (patient_name, patient_age, is_new_patient)

#The variables are lower case and use underscore to seperate different words in the name.
#Python is case sensitive.

#The above variables, integers, floats and booleans are termed as data types in a programming language.
